	<h1>PAULINE BROWN</h1>
	<h2>COMPUTER PROGRAMMING</h2>
	<p>Coding is like the best activity I could ever engage in. I am able to apply all the knowledge I have and even more from online platforms to create something I would like and make it appear the way I want it to. It doesn't limit me from doing my other stuff by the way. I code while listening to music and singing along at times without disrupting my train of thoghts. Whenever I don't get a code right, I go to extensive lengths of research and consultation and apply a combination of knowledge from different sources to make it work.</p>

		<h2>MYSTERY</h2>
		<img src="img/blackwhite.jpg" width="300px" height="200px">
		<p>Mystery is one of the things that thrill me the most. I just love being different from the rest, hard to understand, set my own principles and goals and achieve them differently. For most, the sky is the limit; for me, it is the beginning. My dad derived that slogan for me, "The sky should be your beginning of endless opportunities and full exploitation of potential. Why should you let the sky limit you?"The mystery 'thing' drives me to loving the hollywood movies with extra-ordinary characters.</p>

	<h2>SOCIAL LIFE</h2>
	<p>I am 51% introverted and 49% extraverted according to the personality test I took recently. I doubted it at first; but realized later that it could be true. I talk to anyone and everyone, but I always maintain my circle of close friends to almost 0. I however, find pleasure in helping people who need my assistance and always want people to be happy. I care a lot about how I make people feel thus am extra careful in my relations.</p>

	<div class="float2">
		<h2>NATURE</h2>
		<img src="img/waterfall.jpg" width="300px" height="200px">
		<p>It may not show, but I perceive nature as a very beautiful creation. I admire nature's beauty; it keeps me in constant memory of the fact that God is great as He created such perfect things. Could you imagine He just did it Himself? Without referring anywhere at all. I mean He's just so wonderful. Nature reminds me to always exalt Him with my all.</p>
	</div>

	<h2>SUCCESS</h2>
	<p>I have a thing for success. I hate failing in anything; though also I don't mind trying and failing multiple times before I finally get it right. I love succeeding in being a 'jack of all trades'. I like radiating my success to all the people around me so that we succeed as a team. However, I like it when every member of the team applies themselves in the given task so that we all own the success and none is overburdened by the work load in covering for the in-active ones. In one word, I love responsibility.</p>

	<div class="float3">
		<h2>RELAXATION</h2>
		<img src="img/girlgrass.jpg" width="300px" height="200px">
		<p>Who would ever hate having some time with themselves to just relax? Not me of course. I value my alone time, when I just sit and reflect on my already achieved goals, my setbacks, literally anything and most of all, God's blessings. It is something like gratitude time combined with recollection. At times, I do literally no thinking at this time, if at all that is possible, or maybe I just tell myself that I'm thinking nothing just to refresh my thoughts.</p>
